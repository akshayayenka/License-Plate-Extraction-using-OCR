# License-Plate-Extraction-using-OCR

 
I.	Introduction
This project focuses on utilizing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to accurately extract and interpret license plate information from images. It emphasizes advanced image processing techniques to identify and analyze text in challenging conditions, such as varying lighting, angles, and font styles. By automating this task, the project aims to streamline vehicle identification processes for applications like traffic management and law enforcement.

II.	Model Details
The core of this project is an OCR pipeline optimized for license plate recognition. Key technical specifications include:
•	Model Architecture: Utilizes a deep learning-based text recognition model, fine-tuned for structured and unstructured text detection.
•	Training Dataset: Trained on datasets containing diverse license plate images, ensuring robustness against real-world variations in text style, orientation, and noise.
•	Input Requirements:
•	Image Input: High-resolution images or video frames containing vehicle license plates.
•	Preprocessing: Noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and region of interest (ROI) extraction.
•	Output:
•	Recognized text from the license plates.
•	Metadata including detection confidence scores and bounding box coordinates

III.	App Architecture
The system is designed to deliver high accuracy and efficiency through its modular architecture:
•	Endpoints:
•	/upload: Accepts image or video input for processing.
•	/extract: Returns the extracted text along with metadata.
•	Backend Framework: Developed using FastAPI for quick API responses and scalability.
•	Model Serving: Employs PyTorch/TensorFlow frameworks for OCR tasks.
•	Deployment: Hosted on a cloud-based server, leveraging GPU acceleration for real-time processing.
